You are able to reuse a texture that already exists in your project, here we are using the /example/gui_reuse/gui.atlas
and putting our texture on that already existing image. HOWEVER the functionality to do this isn't that useful,
you will first of have to make sure that the atlas you are reusing is big enough to fit your current Width and Height
you will also have to type out its compiled name which isn't that readable.

We will also have to make sure that the atlas is using the name we think (in this example 'gui').


In the end I can not see a reason to do it this way. The _only_ benefit is that we don't have to 
add another script file for our initial setup as we do in the 'created' workflow.

	-- We have to set it to the resource we update our gui for
	gui.set_texture(node, "gui")
	
	-- We can then pick one of our images and play the flipbook. 
	-- We start a loop to visualise that it actually works
